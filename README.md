# UnityPongLecture

Getting started:
  1. Clone this repo to your computer.
  2. Open unity, do not create a new project but select "open".
  3. Browse to the the repo you just cloned and open it.

You will now have a non-complete Pong game in front of you. The two "bricks" to the left and right are the players, and the circle in the middle is suprisingly enough the ball.
